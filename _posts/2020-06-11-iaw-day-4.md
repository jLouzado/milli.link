Todayâ€™s first session centred on silences and dilemmas within archival spaces. Panelists laid out the marginalised histories of Mental Health and anti-dam protests, emphasising on the role of ideology in shaping the scope and presentation of historical evidence. Questions from the audience then greatly added to the session, ranging from discussions on Manto, madness and partition to nation building and displacement

01:28:04	Aparna Vaidik:	Please do type in your questions in the chat. We will collate them

01:35:17	Aparna Vaidik:	Seems like Prof. Balaram is a rather thorough researcher making historians redundant!

01:39:40	Aparna Vaidik:	David Tyrell Records: http://blog.wellcomelibrary.org/2013/09/fighting-the-cold-war-david-tyrrell-and-the-common-cold/#_ga=2.181260452.26701150.1591889385-1716900898.1591889385

01:42:09	Aparna Vaidik:	Northern Arizona Archives Website: https://nau.edu/special-collections/

01:42:31	Aswin S:	I think some (or much?) of the Wellcome Library is there in archive.org. Not sure if the relevant parts are available there though..

01:43:07	yamaha:	@Kelly and Sam : How does an academic institutional archive that's just starting out, go about setting up a digitization workflow?

01:43:14	yamaha:	What kind of housekeeping do we need to take care of before we jump into scanning and cataloging?

01:46:20	Aparna Vaidik:	Could we talk a little bit about the significance of forgotten histories especially in relation to scientific research

01:47:29	Deepika S:	As archivists, how can we do more to ensure that we have better, more thorough information about women? How can we figure this out at an institutional level?

01:49:12	Tassadaque Hussain:	  Is your Archives also embarking on Microfilming of records, since Microfilms are better for long term archival preservation.

01:50:52	Hari Sridhar:	This discussion is based on the following articles:

01:52:05	Anup Sharma:	It says that "the page cannot be found"



01:52:52	aditi:	How about assigning orchid id to researchers of the past?

01:57:11	Hari Sridhar:	Question for Professor Balaram: I was struck by this quote in your article on Dorothy Hamre: "Time and history blot out small merit and fatten big glory." It is clear why this is a problem in relation to historical accuracy and in terms of providing fair credit for ideas. How do you think it affects the contemporary practice of science?

01:57:14	Tassadaque Hussain:	 Are your digital collections downloadable?

02:00:04	Aparna Vaidik:	Another very interesting article on history of bacteriology: https://mmbr.asm.org/content/mmbr/40/4/793.full.pdf

02:09:26	Milli Network:	qUESTION FROM YOUTUBE: As the coronavirus is a current pandemic but it is some what linked to Dorothy Hamre's work in the past. So how are you trying to preserve this current link in terms of Archiving all the current data? - Patricia (from YouTube)

question from youtube!



02:10:19	aditi:	Thank fully scientists are now living out so much of their lives online now - twitter, Instagram etc. Simplifies things for researchers of tomorrow?
