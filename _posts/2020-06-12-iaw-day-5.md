title: Day 5 - Archiving Community Knowledge // Archives and Crises
layout: post
---

Our discussions this morning brought quite a few new ideas to the table. Panelists introduced us to methods and challenges involved in archiving community knowledge such as that of nomadic storytellers, languages, mud wall paintings, collection techniques, etc. Concerns regarding intellectual property rights, maintaining indigenous safety while decolonising our practise and ensuring consent from beginning to end, were some crucial points that were raised.

01:38:04	Milli Network:	In case of any questions to the speaker, kindly type in the chat and or use the 'raise hand' icon. After your question has been answered you could lower your hand. Thank you.

01:39:03	Nandini Oza:	for Madan Meenaji. Does Bhasha and Adivasi Academy have any mapping and documentation of the tribals displaced by the many large dams in Gujarat like Ukai, Kadana, Damanganga, Dharoi, Sardar Sarovar, etc? 

01:39:08	Aparna Vaidik:	Bhabha Research and Publication Centre: https://www.paramparaproject.org/institution_bhasha.html

01:39:13	Malini Krishnankutty:	Inspiring work, Madan Meenaji! Could you throw some light on the challenges you face. How has development challenged or changed the livelihoods of these indigenous people ?

01:42:12	Marisha Thakur:	For Madan Meena: In your experience, what are the reasons that the young move away from their traditional/indigenous culture? Is the onus only on those communities? If this is related to financial security/changing lifestyle, what is a good/sustainable way for such traditions to continue?

01:42:30	Aparna Vaidik:	Rita Banerjiâ€™s Green Hub: https://www.greenhubindia.net/about-us

01:44:46	dinesh:	i cant see the clip.

02:12:30	Padmini Ray Murray:	@Theresa: It's so great to hear about these resources being built for the community, by the community and protecting access, as they should be - I have a question about how aboriginal community protocols square with putting data and information on social media platforms, where at the level of interface groups are private, but the platform itself has access to all the community's data.

02:14:53	Padmini Ray Murray:	(oh! my q to @Kirsten too)

02:19:44	Padmini Ray Murray:	ty so much Theresa, that's very interesting re: the language use protocol

02:20:35	Milli Network:	From Theresa Sainty- "That is a great question, and one that we grapple with. We consider what we are willing to share on social media before it is put 'out there'. We have developed a Language Use Protocol - and that is on the website and TAC facebook page. One of the main determinants of sharing or allowing language to be used in specific projects, is how will, indeed will it be useful for Aboriginal community."

02:28:21	dinesh:	@malini, we have worked with groups in rajastan, maharastra, ap, karnataka and tn. however, the deployment of phones/apps is/was thru the ngos and maybe about 40 diff pastoralists. this was 5 years ago when there lot fewer smartphones amongst them. we are also revamping the platform now.

02:34:07	Rita Banerji:	Great session ...thanks Kirsten, Dinesh, Madan

02:35:52	Kirsten Thorpe:	Thanks everyone for listening, its been great to connect with you. Here are some links I suggested: https://indigenousarchives.net/

02:36:19	Malini Krishnankutty:	Sharing a thought- and a rhetorical question- I guess in India, we have to wake up not only to the need for de-colonizing our practices, our knowledge, institutions but also wake up to the violence that the post independence Indian state has unleashed (and continues to unleash) on indigenous communities. There is little spotlight in India on the fact that 50-60 MILLION people have been displaced due to developmental projects since independence and the commons are continuously under attack. What is the way forward then? How can we safeguard indigenous knowledge and ways of life?

02:36:50	Kirsten Thorpe:	Mukurtu: an online dilly bag for Indigenous digital archives safe: http://theconversation.com/mukurtu-an-online-dilly-bag-for-keeping-indigenous-digital-archives-safe-112949

02:37:04	Nandini Oza:	Thanks Heather for highlighting that. Thanks a lot.

02:37:50	Kirsten Thorpe:	An example of the State Library of NSW using Mukurtu as a platform to curate their historic collections for community engagement https://gather.sl.nsw.gov.au

02:41:39	Kirsten Thorpe:	Here is the link to the NSW Australian Mukurtu Hub, https://mukurtu-australia-nsw.libraries.wsu.edu and a â€˜NSW Community Archive Toolkitâ€ which is a work in progress - https://mukurtu-australia-nsw.libraries.wsu.edu/digital-heritage/nsw-community-archive-toolkit

02:43:35	Padmini Ray Murray:	@malini: at Design Beku (my org) we envision doing this through empowering and facilitating communities to build those archives - rather than building them ourselves: however, databases are necessary documenting (infra) structural violence - we'll be talking about this later today in the 6pm panel as well

02:46:12	Kush Patel:	@malini and @padmini: such urgent questions that I continue to grapple with as well esp in the context of pedagogy. Looking forward to tonightâ€™s panel, Padmini. and hopefully sharing my predicaments on Sundayâ€™s panel too.

02:57:13	Aparna Vaidik:	Center for community knowledge: http://www.cckonline.in/home.html

03:07:19	suro:	Jatantrust.org

03:10:44	Bharat S:	What are the pros and cons to keeping community archives local vis a vis putting them up on the internet where they have a wider reach and visibility, but where that knowledge is also easily decontextualized and its circulation is harder to control

03:20:38	Nandini Oza:	Thank You. Madanji.

03:28:16	Aparna Vaidik:	Sharing a doc of all the weblinks and readings shared on the chat since Day One. They are organised thematically for easy perusal.

03:35:37	Madhuri Ramesh:	Walking is a Way of Knowing in a Kadar Forest; Speaking to an Elephant and other tales from the Kadars - Madhuri Ramesh and Manish Chandi, illustrated by Matthew Frame. Tara Books, Chennai

03:51:53	Venkat Srinivasan:	Maybe related to Samira's comment. But, in general, this article covers issues of archives, memory and power.

Archives, Records, and Power: The Making of Modern Memory

Joan Schwartz and Terry Cook. 2002.

https://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/methods/schwartz.pdf

One quote from this around questions of margins. "It is important, as Verne Harris has noted, not to romanticize the marginalized, or feel elated for saving them from historical oblivion: some do not wish to be â€œrescuedâ€ by mainstream archives and some will feel their naming by archivists as being â€œmarginalizedâ€ only further marginalizes them." Verne Harris, â€œSeeing (in) Blindness: South Africa, Archives and Passion for Justiceâ€, draft essay for presentation to New Zealand archivists, August 2001.

03:52:23	Padmini Ray Murray:	re: Dinesh's comment - yes, interoperability is very important 

03:54:30	Samira:	Thank you, Venkat. Exactly the point I was making.

03:54:59	salus sage:	re. Dinesh's comment, It will be nice if we are able to get together as / with collaborators for some collective / intersecting goals independent of organisational or other boundaries, 

03:56:03	Ishita Shah:	It was a wonderful session! Thank you. 



Just an unformed curiosity: Are there any parameters (or do we really need them) through which community archiving projects are considered credible or worthy of a discourse across forums? Given that so much of work is happening in small and big ways but only certain projects are spoken about more than the others



Excuse me, if this has already been questions addressed before in the forum and I might have missed it.



Thank you again

Ishita 

03:57:19	Rahi Soren:	Thanks Venkat, this is helpful.

03:59:30	Malini Krishnankutty:	I guess the idea of 'community' itself perhaps needs to be enlarged to include all contexts- the entire spectrum of urban to rural- and landscapes. Today the discussion has focused on marginalized and indigenous communities/tribes. But really we need to expand this idea to all contexts and record our histories and experiences over time..

04:01:16	Amil Varghese:	Do you think tribal museums in India are equipped to undertake archiving in community knowledge? 

04:02:04	Maya Dodd:	@Malini...Fabulous point.. There is so much also happening across urban communities in India that also escapes written knowledge systems. Here's where digital tools and shared protocols might work for all.

04:04:18	Maya Dodd:	Absolutely!!!

04:04:18	Madhuri Ramesh:	@ Malini - even with indigenous communities, many are not homogeneous and are geographically dispersed. So agree with you that we should actively accommodate multiplicity

04:07:11	Hari Sridhar:	Readings and links to websites that have come up in all the Discussions so far: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ot-6VixXhrWliWrkzFt2PsALWr0LjzA_ZSFvcLZdWpE/edit?usp=sharing

04:07:55	The IFA Archive team - Spandana:	@Malini and @Maya, a few of our grantees have been working with urban communities (as well as rural/ indigenous communities). An interesting example that I cannot but share here is the work Hamdasti is doing in Kolkata, called the Chitpur Local project. May be you will find their work interesting too. Here is a link : https://www.hamdasti.com/chitpur-local-2014---16.html

04:08:49	Samira:	Sharing links to some other archives (primarily language focussed) around the world:

04:09:02	Samira:	http://demca.tacc.utexas.edu/

04:09:11	Samira:	https://www.paradisec.org.au/

04:09:57	Samira:	https://elar.soas.ac.uk/

04:10:26	Maya Dodd:	Thanks Spandana!

04:11:53	Padmini Ray Murray:	something to think about is how consensus can work even within a community

04:12:08	Padmini Ray Murray:	because the community itself is not monolithic or homogenous

04:12:22	Rahi Soren:	Thanks Hari :)

04:12:24	The IFA Archive team - Spandana:	And there is a link to the projects that IFA took on as an organisation to encourage archiving and spreading of the knowledge within the Mir musician community can be found here: http://indiaifa.org/grants-and-projects.html?keys=mir&tid=All&tid_1=All&date=All

04:12:46	Ruchi Sharma:	thanks for taking up significant questions and various insights. Most importantly for leaving us with many more questions that might help us shape our works in future

04:12:57	Padmini Ray Murray:	Great work R&F! fantastic session :)

04:13:01	yamaha:	Today's list of links?

04:13:01	Heather Goodall:	thanks everyone! I really appreciated the chance to be here.

04:13:14	Maya Dodd:	Thanks all...This was a fab session ;) 

04:13:18	Madhuri Ramesh:	thank you everyone!

04:13:22	Malini Krishnankutty:	lovely session!

04:13:24	Hari Sridhar:	Thanks to Aparna Vaidik who has been compiling these links and readings.

18:40:45	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   Avehi(Privately) : (I'm v happy with how it's going but just surprised at how quiet it is)

18:40:54	 From  Avehi   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : no no I think its just unfamiliarity

18:41:03	 From  Avehi   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : its really interesting

18:41:06	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   Avehi(Privately) : okay :)

18:43:30	 From  Venkat Srinivasan   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : This is so nicely curated, Padmini! Love how this is playing out.

18:44:00	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   Venkat Srinivasan(Privately) : thank you so much! I was feeling a little stressed because there was no questions, as compared to the other sessions...

18:44:25	 From  Avehi   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : this is really interesting

18:44:36	 From  Venkat Srinivasan   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : Most sessions don't get Qs till later. This morning was an exception, I think. 

18:44:47	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   Avehi(Privately) : yesss, I love it :)

18:44:59	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   Venkat Srinivasan(Privately) : okay :) will stop panicking

18:52:32	 From  Venkat Srinivasan : Sort or related to what Rahul just shared: A repeat photography project in collaboration with the NAU archives, to teach climate change issues: http://news.nau.edu/repeat-photography-partnership-aid-scientists-understanding-climate-change/#.XuOBXDozbIV

18:57:03	 From  Venkat Srinivasan : Corona Caches: https://coronacaches.wordpress.com/

18:58:23	 From  Venkat Srinivasan : Journal of the Plague Year: https://covid19.omeka.net/about

19:06:22	 From  Venkat Srinivasan : Thanks for these presentations. These are very thought provoking. Could any/all speakers share ideas on the selection process without the benefit of time to allow for what is 'meaningful': curating the present. At the other end, what enters the archive X years after an event is a deeply curated subset, mostly by the creator of the archival material.

19:06:30	 From  MAYA DODD   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUB_pOax0z9udQBd4X9DcYOswusw-NJzHaK2pzt63P8/edit

19:07:00	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   MAYA DODD(Privately) : thanks!

19:07:07	 From  Deepika S   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : Hi Padmini, weâ€™re compiling audience questions here (just in case Venkatâ€™s connection doesnâ€™t hold up) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUB_pOax0z9udQBd4X9DcYOswusw-NJzHaK2pzt63P8/edit

19:08:33	 From  Milli Network   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : In case you haven't received it: One question in the chat was how research in the archives is likely to change in the COVID/ post-COVID period. 

19:08:34	 From  MAYA DODD   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : qs from karan: This may be slightly controversial to ask everyone - so you decide whether to ask it:  what about keeping the â€œqualityâ€ of the archive? If the idea of what can be archived is so open... sometimes it can just also get filled with junk. Especially now with these millennials all over social media with their feelings and what not.

19:08:47	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   MAYA DODD(Privately) : hahaha

19:08:58	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   MAYA DODD(Privately) : okay, I'll think of how to frame that

19:09:40	 From  MAYA DODD   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : coolz

19:10:21	 From  Karan Kumar   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : hi Padmini

19:10:26	 From  Karan Kumar   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : maya said to send you my q

19:10:28	 From  Karan Kumar   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : This may be slightly controversial to ask everyone - but also what about keeping the â€œqualityâ€ of the archive? If the idea of what can be archived is so open... sometimes it can just also get filled with junk. Especially now with these millennials all over social media with their feelings and what not.

19:11:34	 From  Amil Varghese : My question is to Rahul Chopra. In you lecture,there was no mention about indigenous knowledge systems/practices. Don't you think it is necessary to incorporate such knowledge systems/ practices in discourses on climate change and conservation methods?    

19:11:48	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   Karan Kumar(Privately) : yes, thanks! I'll frame it a bit differently

19:12:01	 From  Amil Varghese : *read as In your lecture

19:12:36	 From  Rajmaniâ€™s iPhone : Can any speaker shed light what is future of traditional archives in post Corona period.

19:13:05	 From  Karan Kumar   to   Padmini Ray Murray(Privately) : Thank you!

19:18:12	 From  Padmini Ray Murray   to   Venkat Srinivasan(Privately) : should I aim to wrap up after this?

19:19:42	 From  Amil Varghese : Thank you for answering the question.

19:19:52	 From  Avehi : This was very interesting, thank you

19:21:05	 From  Swati Chawla : Thanks everyone!
