Our discussions this morning brought quite a few new ideas to the table. Panelists introduced us to methods and challenges involved in archiving community knowledge such as that of nomadic storytellers, languages, mud wall paintings, collection techniques, etc. Concerns regarding intellectual property rights, maintaining indigenous safety while decolonising our practise and ensuring consent from beginning to end, were some crucial points that were raised.
