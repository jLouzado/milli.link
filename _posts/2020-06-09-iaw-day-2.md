title: Day 2 - Forms of the Archival Object // Revisiting oral histories
layout: post
---

Moving from archives to the role of museums, our panelists today focused on questions around archival objects, communicating relevance and improving accessibility. Methods of preservation were also discussed, as was the protocol followed by different archivists when processing new material. The second half of the session was an open discussion on oral histories that emphasised on ethical aspects of the practise. Subjectivities of different people, why and how our memories can be selective, as well as the manner in which oral history tends to run against dominant narratives was also central to the conversation.

11:30:07	 From  Aparna Vaidik : How are the collections of the various State archives in India done? Are municipalities bound to record and archive their papers etc.?

11:31:04	 From  Anjali : When it comes to institution archives, how much does state censorship and control affect the rules and regulations of the archives? Are their rules for certain "sensitive" records becoming declassified and open to the public after a period of time?

11:33:45	 From  Wasif : Are the folk narratives and folk songs, especially with regards to pastoral communities, being archived given that these oral narratives might be the only entry point into those pasts, otherwise absent in traditional archival material.

11:33:48	 From  Bharat S : I think the shifts in the kind of public that consults a government archive with the coming of RTI is really significant. How is the National Archive adapting its protocols and practices to accommodate people with a non-research background?

11:34:36	 From  MAYA DODD : @ Wasif, do tune in : 12 Jun 10:30 // 11:45 - 13:30

11:57:54	 From  Milli Network   to   deepikas(Privately) : This is OH related from earlier session: maybe you can include this: How does one negotiate individual research involving oral history and larger archival initiatives? As in, if I am conducting interviews as part of my individual research, at what stage, and in what form, can it become part of an institutionalized archive? What are the parameters ?



11:58:43	 From  deepikas   to   Milli Network(Privately) : Thanks, itâ€™s on the list :)

11:58:49	 From  Venkat Srinivasan   to   Milli Network(Privately) : Can you make deepikas as co-host? (Deepika, IISc). Not the other Deepika (Deepika Sharma).

12:00:33	 From  Milli Network   to   Venkat Srinivasan(Privately) : Ah ok. Sorry. 

12:01:18	 From  yamaha : @roland The Internet Archive is an excellent resource for born digital content and often permissive in their sharing policies. How can brick-and-mortar archives like yours leverage the infrastructure like that of The Internet Archives? Institutes like the IITs and NCBS have tonnes of internal repositories that have software developed which could have archival value. On a similar note, a good portion of student campus lives Indian universities since the late nineties have been  documented on campus networks and mailing list. It's not exactly oral history in the traditional sense but born digital and of equal distinction.

12:04:01	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Sritama (Spivaking) has had her hand up for a while now. 

12:05:47	 From  Milli Network   to   deepikas(Privately) : Thanks. Sorry, I think I added the wrong Deepika as co-host earlier. 

12:06:11	 From  Malini Krishnankutty : Yesterday there was a comment that you need to wait 8 years before material from someone who passes away can become part of an archive from the time the person passes away.. I don't know if I understood correctly. Is this true of oral histories as well?

12:07:54	 From  Bharat S   to   Milli Network(Privately) : How do I raise my hand to ask a question?

12:09:02	 From  Milli Network   to   Bharat S(Privately) : You will see an icon next to your name in the participant list. Tell me if you see it. Or it might be in the More option.

12:09:56	 From  Bharat S   to   Milli Network(Privately) : I don't see it. I have Unmute, Rename and Edit Profile Picture

12:09:59	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Padmini has her hand up. But you take a call on whether you want to take some chat questions first. 

12:10:05	 From  Bharat S   to   Milli Network(Privately) : Oh wait I see it. Nvm

12:10:29	 From  Sritama : thank you, thatâ€™s helpful !

12:10:39	 From  Milli Network   to   Bharat S(Privately) : Found it? 

12:11:34	 From  Bharat S   to   Milli Network(Privately) : Yup! thanks

12:12:15	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Bharat has his hand raised. 

12:14:57	 From  Avehi   to   Milli Network(Privately) : will go to him next and then FB question

12:15:58	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Ok. there are also a few chat questions. have you got them from Deepika?

12:20:24	 From  dhanashree thorat : Q for Nandini: I know activist archives are often concerned about government/police surveillance and how archival material can be misused against activists. Has this been a concern for the archival projects you have been involved in?

12:23:49	 From  Nandini Oza : Yes Dhanashree, we encounter this many many times

12:30:10	 From  Avehi   to   Milli Network(Privately) : how long is this session?

12:30:45	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : It's scheduled to go on till 1:30. 

12:32:57	 From  bhanu : re. app for OH https://storycorps.org/

12:33:23	 From  Milli Network : App for short-form oral histories linked to pictures: https://www.pixstori.com/ 

12:35:15	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Suggestion: you could also ask other participants to chip in, if they have views/relevant experience related to a question.

12:37:30	 From  Avehi   to   Milli Network(Privately) : do we have any more questions? or would someone like to share their OH engagement?

12:38:52	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Another question: Yesterday there was a comment that you need to wait 8 years before material from someone who passes away can become part of an archive from the time the person passes away.. I don't know if I understood correctly. Is this true of oral histories as well?



12:40:32	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : There might be people who are interested in starting oral history work - maybe some questions related to that - books to refer to, OH collections to look at, is there training for OH in India?

12:41:05	 From  Avehi   to   Milli Network(Privately) : thank you -sorry  Iâ€™m drawing a blank

12:43:52	 From  Milli Network : Indira Chowdhury mentioned this OH collection:

12:44:00	 From  Milli Network : https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/collections/subjectarea/index.html

12:44:47	 From  Milli Network   to   Bharat S(Privately) : Do you have another question? 

12:45:26	 From  Bharat S   to   Milli Network(Privately) : Yeah, a comment actually, if I may. I promise to keep it brief :)

12:46:04	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Bharat wants to make a brief comment

12:47:40	 From  Indira : Heather mentioned this:

12:47:42	 From  Indira : https://storiesofstrength.com.au/seventy-years-in-australia/

12:49:30	 From  Venkat Srinivasan : Apologies for the terrible Internet connection. Hope this is what Avehi asked. The Archives at NCBS (http://archives.ncbs.res.in/) is a very new space (in its physical 'built-up' form). The archive has conducted about 70 short interviews of people across the hierarchy within the institution. The catalog can be accessed through the archive website (http://catalogue.archives.ncbs.res.in/). It's a very small attempt for now, but it's a direction we'd like to take it going forward. We're also now training students to the best of our abilities, both in getting them to do a critical hearing+summarize interviews and to also conduct interviews. The other thing we really want to do is build a space where you can see connections between these different forms of history: orality, a physical object, and the textual record. So, in some of the exhibitions created on the Archives website, you'll see some attempts at making these connections (http://stories.archives.ncbs.res.in/exhibit/13ways/).

12:50:05	 From  dhanashree thorat : Thank you for your answer!!

12:50:12	 From  Heather Goodall : And here is the home page of Stories of Strength: https://storiesofstrength.com.au/

12:51:06	 From  Venkat Srinivasan : The Stories - 13 Ways - referred to up here was created with the help of Janastu, https://janastu.org/ (they will be speaking on June 13).

12:52:02	 From  AR : follow up question to nandini:  how do these concerns of surveillance and police/court oversight factor in when you are planning how/where to store and make the oral history archive accessible? 

12:52:31	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : Venkat's message (which he has already posted to everyone in the chat box): Apologies for the terrible Internet connection. Hope this is what Avehi asked. The Archives at NCBS (http://archives.ncbs.res.in/) is a very new space (in its physical 'built-up' form).

12:54:51	 From  Nandini Oza : Answer to AR, I would like this question to be answered by Heather and Indira as that will be a learning for me too. 

12:55:04	 From  Titas Bose : followup question to Indira: While the narrator- researcher negotiation you spoke about with response to interview publication, can be an individualistic experience, in many cases, it is a structural erasure. How do you as a researcher check your power relation with your narrator, for a more accurate and ethical representation of their voice?

12:56:11	 From  Padmini Ray Murray : For those of you interested in protest archives, risks and threats: we will definitely be touching upon this in the panel at times of crises that I will be moderating on the 12th - Francesca Recchia from The Polis Project in particular, will be speaking to these concerns 

12:59:43	 From  Milli Network   to   Avehi(Privately) : If you need more questions: How do oral historians judge evidence from interviews, given the fallibility of memory?

13:00:18	 From  Milli Network : The Boston Tapes, which Indira mentioned: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797

13:00:46	 From  Nandini Oza : Thanks Indira and I agree with you fully.
