**What are your favourite works** that fit this bill? What thoughts or questions about archives do they dig up for you? **Help us build this resource** by sending us your recommendations [here ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesoH9eJCTiwFNWMpQk2S_cGmNt1uqOGqfTX6QG3DE6LBBDBA/viewform)before June 11.

* **Gadhi (2010) by Prashant Bagad**
  * **Language**: Marathi
  * **Form**: Short story
  * **Connection to archives**: This is a tragic-comic take on how an assistant librarian, fiercely possessive of books, deploys hilarious strategies to protect the books from readers, defeating the whole purpose behind setting up a library. Frustrated, the protagonist imagines a story within this story where he is the supreme ruler of the library who ends up executing his own younger self. Although this work features a library, it touches upon issues critical to archiving as well, raising questions about accessibility and poking fun at the possessiveness of gatekeepers.

  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * **Connection to archives**: Genly Ai is an envoy sent to convince countries on the planet of Gethen to join a confederation of planets called Ekumen. Many chapters in this sci-fi novel are presented as archival records from different countries and planets, arranged to tell the story of Genly’s quest. Though the book is best known for its treatment of sex and gender, it also provokes questions about the relationship between archives and facts, storytelling, and culture.

* **Alphabet of Thorn (2005) by Patricia A. McKillip**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * **Connection to archives**: The kingdom of Raine has a library (which is more of an archive, really, though it is never called that) embedded at the base of the palace. Nepenthe, an orphan raised by the librarians, is a translator mesmerised by a work of epic poetry that is both a historical record and a love letter from mother to daughter. Among other things, this truly wonderful book explores just how much of a hold stories and records can have over us, how they provide a powerful connection to the past, and how they can be at the core of our identities and still not do a good job of representing who we really are.

Here, archival records, even when created with good intentions, have enormous (and adverse) consequences for vulnerable people whose lives they document.

* **The Handmaid's Tale (1985)  Margaret Atwood**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * This dystopian tale set in the United States that's been converted into a theonomy, "The Republic of Gilead", is told through the voice of one woman, Offred, whose narrative switches between the past and present. It's only at the end of the novel that we realise that this entire narrative was part of a historical record; that Offred had recorded her story on cassette tapes that were transcribed by historians and are now being studied as archival material — and the limitations of archival material are noted in the fact that we never find out what ultimately happened to Offred; we (and the characters at the end of the novel who are delving into Offred's story)  are left to construct an ending for her story, to "fill in the gaps" , an act which would probably reveal more about the reader's/archivists circumstances and psychology than the protagonist's or the writer's.
