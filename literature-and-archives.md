We’re creating a crowdsourced list of **fiction and poetry** that features archives, or **helps us think about, imagine or question archives** and archiving. 

**What are your favourite works** that fit this bill? What thoughts or questions about archives do they dig up for you? **Help us build this resource** by sending us your recommendations [here ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesoH9eJCTiwFNWMpQk2S_cGmNt1uqOGqfTX6QG3DE6LBBDBA/viewform)before June 11.

* **The Bridge of Migration (2017) by Yogesh Maitreya**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Poetry collection 
  * **Connection to the archives**: Maitreya’s powerful poetry reminds us of widespread incidents of caste discrimination and violence that are deliberately erased from public records, never letting us forget how central it is to life in India. The poems also document the lived experience of Dalit women and men, highlighting their anger as well as their courage and confidence in challenging this state of affairs. In the absence of historical narratives and records that include the stories of Dalit people, the poems take on the task of preserving and commemorating the incidents and memories that cannot be erased.

* **Gadhi (2010) by Prashant Bagad**
  * **Language**: Marathi
  * **Form**: Short story
  * **Connection to archives**: This is a tragic-comic take on how an assistant librarian, fiercely possessive of books, deploys hilarious strategies to protect the books from readers, defeating the whole purpose behind setting up a library. Frustrated, the protagonist imagines a story within this story where he is the supreme ruler of the library who ends up executing his own younger self. Although this work features a library, it touches upon issues critical to archiving as well, raising questions about accessibility and poking fun at the possessiveness of gatekeepers.

* **Teresa (2013) by Nisha Susan**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Short story
  * **Connection to archives**: An homage to Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca, the plot is driven forward by the discovery of an old blog in which one of the story’s main characters recorded her thoughts about her life and the people in it, which form a stark contrast to her public life and the way she was seen. It reminds us that stories of women’s inner lives, often undervalued, can also be records that tell us important things about the world and society we live in.

* **The ‘Feluda’ series by Satyajit Ray** 
  * **Language**: Bengali 
  * **Form**: Novels, short stories 
  * **Connection to the archives**: Siddheshwar Bose (Siddhu Jyatha) is a recurring character in the ‘Feluda’ series, in which the private detective Prodosh C Mitter or Feluda solves mysteries with his cousin and unofficial assistant Topshe. With an extensive collection of newspaper clippings that aid his photographic memory, Siddhu Jyatha is an invaluable resource of crucial information. No wonder then, that Feluda and Topshe spend hours listening to his winding stories, made longer still by the painstakingly slow sips of tea and deep puffs of cheroot. Relatable perhaps for archivists of all kinds, is the pure pride and joy Siddhu lights up with at every chance he gets to prove the value of his collection.

* **Frederick (1967) by Leo Lionni** 
  * **Languag**e: English
  * **Form**: Children’s Book 
  * **Connection to Archives**: Frederick is the story of a little mouse poet. While his friends prepare for the long winter by collecting food, he sits and observes the world, storing words about the warmth of the sun, the pattern of seasons, and the colours all around them. It’s a story that questions what our basic needs are for survival, what work society considers valuable, and what role archivists, writers, poets, and observers have to play in society.

* **The Night Bookmobile (2008) by Audrey Niffenegger**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Graphic novel, originally serialised in The Guardian 
  * **Connection to archives**: In a bad mood and walking about one night, Alexandra chances upon the kindly Mr Openshaw and his Night Bookmobile. He invites her to look through the books, and despite the lateness of the hour and the possible danger, she's tempted. Inside, she finds every single book she'd ever read, indeed everything she's ever read. She quickly becomes obsessed with this disappearing library and its archive—her own collection, her own history, in a way.

* **The Avengers #28 (1966)** 
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Comic
  * **Connection to archives**: The Collector, Taneleer Tivan (played by Benicio del Toro in the Avengers movies), makes his first appearance in #28 of the Avengers comic series. This villain’s goal is to collect and preserve objects and species from across the galaxy. He even tries to collect one of the Avengers! His interest in people and creatures is as specimens, rather than as conscious beings, and he’ll do anything to get his hands on a new addition to his collection. He’s a sort of corporate-colonial archivist, just with untidy hair and a cape.

* **The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) by Ursula Le Guin**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * **Connection to archives**: Genly Ai is an envoy sent to convince countries on the planet of Gethen to join a confederation of planets called Ekumen. Many chapters in this sci-fi novel are presented as archival records from different countries and planets, arranged to tell the story of Genly’s quest. Though the book is best known for its treatment of sex and gender, it also provokes questions about the relationship between archives and facts, storytelling, and culture.

* **Alphabet of Thorn (2005) by Patricia A. McKillip**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * **Connection to archives**: The kingdom of Raine has a library (which is more of an archive, really, though it is never called that) embedded at the base of the palace. Nepenthe, an orphan raised by the librarians, is a translator mesmerised by a work of epic poetry that is both a historical record and a love letter from mother to daughter. Among other things, this truly wonderful book explores just how much of a hold stories and records can have over us, how they provide a powerful connection to the past, and how they can be at the core of our identities and still not do a good job of representing who we really are.

* **Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith #10 (2018) by Charles Soule and Giuseppe Camuncoli**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Comic
  * **Connection to archives**: Jocasta Nu, the former Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives, has to hide a record of children who could potentially become Jedi to stop it from falling into evil hands. To protect the information in the record that she herself created, but which has now put all of these children at risk, she ends up dying. Here, archival records, even when created with good intentions, have enormous (and adverse) consequences for vulnerable people whose lives they document.

* **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) by Philip K Dick** 
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel 
  * **Connection to Archives**: Set in a dystopian world, this iconic novel follows the journey of a bounty hunter tasked with killing six rebel androids. Fitted with memory implants of childhoods they never lived and feelings they never felt, these androids struggle to piece together a sense of identity. The story makes us consider some unsettling possibilities—are there ways in which our lives may be archived and used in the future by power hungry States and tech giants? And how do you make sense of yourself when your story has been handed to you, rather than experienced directly?

* **A Memory Called Empire (2019) by Arkady Martine**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * This is a science fiction novel, part-space opera, part-whodunit, while also exploring the mechanisms of colonial conquest as a cultural and psychological project as much as a military one. The novel follows the newly appointed Ambassador of Lsel Station, a small space station that operates in the shadow of the vast and ever expanding Teixcalaanli Empire, as she navigates the politics of the Imperial Court. All this, while attempting to solve the mystery of what happened to her predecessor and simultaneously hiding her own/her people's big secret: that they have the technology to transfer the memories and consciousness of one person to another, achieving a sort of functional immortality. In other words, you are literally the memory of your ancestors; "institutional memory" in this case is entirely personal.

* **The Handmaid's Tale (1985)  Margaret Atwood**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * This dystopian tale set in the United States that's been converted into a theonomy, "The Republic of Gilead", is told through the voice of one woman, Offred, whose narrative switches between the past and present. It's only at the end of the novel that we realise that this entire narrative was part of a historical record; that Offred had recorded her story on cassette tapes that were transcribed by historians and are now being studied as archival material — and the limitations of archival material are noted in the fact that we never find out what ultimately happened to Offred; we (and the characters at the end of the novel who are delving into Offred's story)  are left to construct an ending for her story, to "fill in the gaps" , an act which would probably reveal more about the reader's/archivists circumstances and psychology than the protagonist's or the writer's.

* **Zong! (2016) By NourbeSe Phillip** 
  * **Languag**e: English 
  * **Form**: Poem 
  * **Connection to archives**: This book-length poem is composed entirely using words from the Gregson vs. Gilbert case report of 1783. The case report recounts the massacre of enslaved Africans in 1781 on the slave ship Zong, and the ship owner’s attempt to claim insurance for those who were murdered. The poem excavates this forgotten legal text and in the process draws attention to how certain archival materials (and inconvenient truths about slavery) are deliberately made invisible. Zong! beautifully extends the boundaries of the poetic form to deal with questions of forgetting and mourning.
