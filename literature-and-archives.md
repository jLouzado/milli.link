* **Gadhi (2010) by Prashant Bagad**
  * **Language**: Marathi
  * **Form**: Short story
  * **Connection to archives**: This is a tragic-comic take on how an assistant librarian, fiercely possessive of books, deploys hilarious strategies to protect the books from readers, defeating the whole purpose behind setting up a library. Frustrated, the protagonist imagines a story within this story where he is the supreme ruler of the library who ends up executing his own younger self. Although this work features a library, it touches upon issues critical to archiving as well, raising questions about accessibility and poking fun at the possessiveness of gatekeepers.

* **Teresa (2013) by Nisha Susan**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Short story
  * **Connection to archives**: An homage to Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca, the plot is driven forward by the discovery of an old blog in which one of the story’s main characters recorded her thoughts about her life and the people in it, which form a stark contrast to her public life and the way she was seen. The story expands what we might think of as the act of archiving, and reminds us that stories of women’s inner lives, often undervalued, can also be records that tell us important things about the world and society we live in.

* **Frederick (1967) by Leo Lionni** 
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Children’s Book 
  * **Connection to Archives**: Frederick is the story of a little mouse poet. While his friends prepare for the long winter by collecting food, he sits and observes the world, storing words about the warmth of the sun, the pattern of seasons, and the colours all around them. It’s a story that questions what our basic needs are for survival, what work society considers valuable, and what role archivists, writers, poets, and observers have to play in society.

* **The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin**
  * **Language**: English
  * **Form**: Novel
  * **Connection to archives**: Genly Ai is an envoy sent to convince countries on the planet of Gethen to join a confederation of planets called Ekumen. Many chapters in this sci-fi novel are presented as archival records from different countries and planets, arranged to tell the story of Genly’s quest. Though the book is best known for its treatment of sex and gender, it also raises questions about the relationship between archives and facts, storytelling, culture and nationhood.
