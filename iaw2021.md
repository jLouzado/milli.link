    **Description**
    Panel of  lightning talks that connects Archives and the Digital Humanities in various educational contexts :
    â€¢        How do pedagogues introduce archives into the classroom? For what purposes? How is pedagogical authority and intent problematized/complicated/subverted by the inherently authoritarian nature of an archive (etymological root in the Greek word arkhÄ“, which means both commencement and commandment)? How can minority or non-normative subjectivities and politics be introduced through such pedagogical strategies based in archives?
â€¢        What are some success stories/challenges/limitations that educators have faced in teaching with and through archives? Do digital archives work better in modern (the word can be interrogated) classrooms? Do such pedagogues necessarily identify as digital humanists? Why or why not?
