    Who has access to the archive? How can archives support physical, intellectual and cultural access through their design and in their long-term development?

Staff, students and alumni from the MA Curating Collections and Heritage, University of Brighton (UK), address these questions in order to consider how the logic of the archive can engage with the requirements of the user. This panel will begin with short presentations considering case studies from our practice and research, and conclude with a roundtable discussion.

### Archives and the City


---

* 15:00 - 16:30   
* **Description** 

   The city is not simply a geographical location but a set of relationships in space, both within city limits and outside the city’s demarcated boundaries. This panel explores what it means to capture a city’s history through the ‘archive’. How do archives grapple with the mobility of cities and their inhabitants, who move freely between the city and its hinterland? Can a city archive aspire to be more than just a repository of information, becoming instead an active component of the material and social infrastructure of urban spaces? This panel is an attempt at generating a critical discourse on city archives as active ingredients in a city’s collective existence. This holds true for smaller cities and towns as much as it does for the large metropolis. Archiving the city means, among other things knowing the city as a space of promise and aspiration as well as acts of everyday violence, it means learning to look at the city at different scales, and locating local histories within larger geopolitical frameworks.

### Archiving In and From South Asia (Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, India)


---

*  16:45 - 18:15 
  
*   **Description**

     Archiving is a vibrant, emergent field in South Asia. While many examples of archives and archival work outside of the bounds of the bureaucratic state exist in its history, we currently find ourselves in a new era of archival praxis, marked by the emergence of new media technology, digital humanities, and the ‘archival turn’ in social sciences and the humanities. This panel is an attempt to situate this emergent archival paradigm within the context of doing archival work in South Asia, and in the Global South more generally, by bringing together archivists working in different South Asian countries. What does it mean to do archival work in South Asian countries at this historical juncture? Are there shared concerns, challenges and promises and historically significant divergences? What can we learn from each other? We explore this central question along a number of different axes - archival standards and practices, the economics of funding, articulations of the digital and the analog, archival publics in South Asia, histories of conflict and violence, and many others.

### Cultural Heritage and Imperial Apologies


---

* 18:30 - 20:00  
  
*   **Description**

     What does it mean to conduct public history as a South Asianist in the UK? How do you work in an environment in which imperial history is invisible or popularly understood as vastly different from your own research findings? This panel comprises three researchers who have been involved in reimagining public engagement of history in the UK and offering our own interpretations of what ‘decolonising’ it might mean. Each of these contributions offers an individual insight on the situation in the UK, collectively they offer a timely contribution to a universal issue.

`COVID-19 | CARE | VISUALIZING ARCHIVES | DIGITAL HUMANITIES`

### Panel


---

* 15:00 - 16:30 
    
    
* **Description**

    Panel of  lightning talks that connects Archives and the Digital Humanities in various educational contexts :
    •        How do pedagogues introduce archives into the classroom? For what purposes? How is pedagogical authority and intent problematized/complicated/subverted by the inherently authoritarian nature of an archive (etymological root in the Greek word arkhē, which means both commencement and commandment)? How can minority or non-normative subjectivities and politics be introduced through such pedagogical strategies based in archives?
•        What are some success stories/challenges/limitations that educators have faced in teaching with and through archives? Do digital archives work better in modern (the word can be interrogated) classrooms? Do such pedagogues necessarily identify as digital humanists? Why or why not?
