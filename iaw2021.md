`Spaces | Cities | Migrations | South Asia | Repatriation`


### Archives and the City


---

* 15:00 - 16:30   

* **Description** 

   The city is not simply a geographical location but a set of relationships in space, both within city limits and outside the city’s demarcated boundaries. This panel explores what it means to capture a city’s history through the ‘archive’. How do archives grapple with the mobility of cities and their inhabitants, who move freely between the city and its hinterland? Can a city archive aspire to be more than just a repository of information, becoming instead an active component of the material and social infrastructure of urban spaces? This panel is an attempt at generating a critical discourse on city archives as active ingredients in a city’s collective existence. This holds true for smaller cities and towns as much as it does for the large metropolis. Archiving the city means, among other things knowing the city as a space of promise and aspiration as well as acts of everyday violence, it means learning to look at the city at different scales, and locating local histories within larger geopolitical frameworks.

### Archiving in and from South Asia (Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, India)


---

*  16:45 - 18:15 
  
*   **Description**

     Archiving is a vibrant, emergent field in South Asia. While many examples of archives and archival work outside of the bounds of the bureaucratic state exist in its history, we currently find ourselves in a new era of archival praxis, marked by the emergence of new media technology, digital humanities, and the ‘archival turn’ in social sciences and the humanities. This panel is an attempt to situate this emergent archival paradigm within the context of doing archival work in South Asia, and in the Global South more generally, by bringing together archivists working in different South Asian countries. What does it mean to do archival work in South Asian countries at this historical juncture? Are there shared concerns, challenges and promises and historically significant divergences? What can we learn from each other? We explore this central question along a number of different axes - archival standards and practices, the economics of funding, articulations of the digital and the analog, archival publics in South Asia, histories of conflict and violence, and many others.

### Cultural Heritage and the Imperial Past


---

* 18:30 - 20:00  
  
*   **Description**

     What does cultural heritage mean in a postcolonial context? How do we reimagine the ownership of cultural heritage, and what it means to ‘own’ heritage in the first place? This panel comprises researchers, museum curators and heritage conservationists spanning the UK and India who have been involved in reimagining cultural heritage histories in a postcolonial context, in spaces as diverse as the university classroom, the archive, and the museum, offering diverse interpretations of what ‘decolonising’ heritage, embodied in narratives, practices, and objects, might mean. Each of these contributions offers an individual insight on the situation in the UK and India, collectively they offer a timely contribution to a universal issue.

`Covid-19 | Care | Visualizing Archives | Digital Humanities`

### Archives and the Digital Humanities


---

* 15:00 - 16:30 
    
    
* **Description**

    Panel of  lightning talks that connects Archives and the Digital Humanities in various educational contexts :
    •        How do pedagogues introduce archives into the classroom? For what purposes? How is pedagogical authority and intent problematized/complicated/subverted by the inherently authoritarian nature of an archive (etymological root in the Greek word arkhē, which means both commencement and commandment)? How can minority or non-normative subjectivities and politics be introduced through such pedagogical strategies based in archives?
•        What are some success stories/challenges/limitations that educators have faced in teaching with and through archives? Do digital archives work better in modern (the word can be interrogated) classrooms? Do such pedagogues necessarily identify as digital humanists? Why or why not?

### Digital Deccan


---

* 15:00 - 16:15  
  
*   **Description**

    From the Pandyas to the Portugese and beyond, the languages spoken across the shifting boundaries of the Deccan region of India serve up a fascinating archival challenge.

### Urdu Across Indian Archives


---

* 16:30 - 17:45  

* **Description**

  Though archives in Urdu exist across the South Asian region, this panel seeks to explore the variety of materials found in Urdu and Persian around Indian libraries and archives. These languages, while critical to understanding the larger history of the subcontinent, also offer an interesting path for future adaptations. Whether it is the popularity of poetry in Rekhta or gems of Indo-Islamic culinary heritage in the Rampur Raza library, new initiatives like the Urdu project are rearranging archival materials for new audiences in a digital age.
